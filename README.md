### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nik Bougalis.

#### What I'm doing

I am currently Chief Technology Officer at [Marco Financial](https://marcofi.com) working with an amazing team, both technical and non-technical.

#### What I've done

A lot! I led an amazing team of C++ engineers at [Ripple](https://ripple.com), developed some cool technology at [Samsung](https://samsung.com) and co-founded [CodeLaboratories](https://codelaboratories.com/).

Over the past twenty five years, I have developed just about everythingâ€”from shiny user interfaces to low-level kernel drivers. I've worked on scaling blockchains systems, developed consensus algorithms, coded servers that handle tens of thousands of users, created kernel and BIOS drivers to optimize HDD and SSD perfromance, and worked on early iterations of encrypted distributed storage and backup systems.

#### My Interests

My interests are diverse. Currently I'm focused on blockchain, cryptography, security, software integrity and protection and secure computing and storage.
