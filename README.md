## ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nik Bougalis.

### What I've done

I am a cryptographer and a software engineer with a robust academic background, significant management experience and over 20 years of practical, hands-on development experience, primarily in C++.

I have developed just about everything from shiny user interfaces to low-level kernel drivers. Iâ€™ve worked on servers that handle tens of thousands of users, caching software that accelerates hard drives using SSDs, encrypted communications systems and secure distributed storage & backup systems. 

Together with [Alex Popovich](http://alexpopovich.com/), I co-founded [CodeLaboratories](https://codelaboratories.com/), which has gone on to develop a range of successful software and hardware products including the [DUO3D](https://duo3d.com/) stereo camera. 

### My Interests

My interests are diverse. Currently my professional interests are focused on blockchain and fintech, security and distributed computing.

I enjoy reading books, primarily on physics and philosophy, but will devour just about any non-fiction work placed in front of me. I have been involved with remote control cars and planes for many years and derive a lot of satisfaction from that.
