### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Nik Bougalis.

#### What I'm doing
**Director, XPRING Engineering** at [**Ripple**](https://ripple.com)

I am a software engineer and cryptographer. At Ripple, I work on open-source code, mostly around the XRP Ledger. My goal is to build a settlement solution that allows for real-time low-cost international payments over a global network that is open to everyone but is owned by no-one. Check out the [`rippled`](https://github.com/ripple/rippled) GitHub repo, which is the backbone of that effort.

I am also working on something cool at [**Number8**](http://www.number8.us/).

#### What I've done

A lot! I co-founded CodeLaboratories, a successful software and hardware company which makes the DUO3D stereo camera. Over the past twenty years, I have developed just about everythingâ€”from shiny user interfaces to low-level kernel drivers. I've worked on servers that handle tens of thousands of users, caching software that accelerates hard drives using SSDs and encrypted distributed storage & backup systems.

#### My Interests

My interests are diverse. Currently I'm focused on blockchain, cryptography, security, software integrity and protection and secure computing and storage.
